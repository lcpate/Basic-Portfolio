		<img src="assets/images/Profile pic_Fotor.jpg" alt="profile pic">
	
		<p> I was born in Chapel Hill, North Carolina in early January of 1992, I was eight days late so I made my parents miss out on an extra tax break. I got the pleasure of being the only girl of four kids, and I am essentially the middle child since my two younger brothers are twins. </p>
